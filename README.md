### A cross-browser extension for Twitter to bring [@WhatIsAWomanBot](https://twitter.com/WhatIsAWomanBot) features into your browser created by [@bethylamine](https://twitter.com/bethylamine).

Thank you to [@VehpuS](https://twitter.com/VehpuS) for helping me get started with extension development!

## Features

* Highlight users on WhatIsAWomanBot's transphobe database
* Report transphobes/appeal unfair labels (not available on iOS Safari)
* Hide media/tweets from transphobes behind interstitials (prevent shock posting)

## Future Features

* Ability to highlight hashtags / report transphobic hashtags
* Add trans-supportive library tool to provide you with relevant trans-supportive information you can reply with quickly
* Auto-suggest debunking sources

If you have any cool ideas, please pop a message into the **Issues** tab, or message me, [@bethylamine](https://twitter.com/bethylamine), on Twitter.

## Conflicts

The extension works while Shinigami Eyes is installed, but for the best experience, disable Shinigami Eyes while using this extension.

The extension should also work with GoodTwitter2.
